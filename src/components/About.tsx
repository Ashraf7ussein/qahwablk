          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            In 2019, we started QahwaBLK with a simple yet bold question: Could
            we consistently deliver an exceptional cup of coffee without the
            hefty price tag or intimidating atmosphere? This question became our
            mission, leading us to create a space where everyone feels welcome.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our approach strips away the complexities, focusing on quality
            coffee and genuine interactions. It's not just our baristas who make
            QahwaBLK special â€” it's the culture they embody and share with every
            customer. By marrying straightforward marketing with our team's
            passion, we've turned every visit into an opportunity for
            connection, making QahwaBLK a place where coffee lovers gather not
            just for the beverage, but for the experience that comes with it.
